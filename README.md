## 🔧 Configuration

### Server Port

The default port is `8080`. To change it:

**For Python server:**
Edit `server.py` and modify the `PORT` variable:
```python
PORT = 8080  # Change to your desired port
```

**For Docker:**
Update the port mapping in `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
ports:
  - "8080:8080"  # Change the first port to your desired host port
```

### Webamp Configuration

The Webamp instance can be customized by modifying the initialization in `index.html`:
```javascript
const webamp = new window.Webamp({
  // Add configuration options here
  // See: https://github.com/captbaritone/webamp#usage
});
```

Available configuration options include:
- Initial skin
- Initial tracks
- Window layout preferences
- And more...

## 🎨 Using the Player

Once the application is running:

1. **Load Audio**: Drag and drop audio files onto the player or use the playlist editor
2. **Pre-loaded Content**: The player starts with 7 tracks including streaming radio stations
3. **Streaming Radio**: Play live internet radio from SomaFM and Radio Paradise
4. **Visualizations**: Click the visualization area to cycle through different effects
5. **Equalizer**: Open the equalizer window for audio adjustments
6. **Playlist**: Manage your music queue with the playlist editor
7. **Skins**: Change the appearance from 4 available skins (right-click → Skins)
8. **Auto-Save**: Your playlist is automatically saved and restored on page reload

- **Manual save**: Saves when you close the browser tab
- **Smart merge**: Combines saved playlists with default tracks
- **Local storage**: Uses browser localStorage (no server required)

## 🐳 Docker Details

### Health Check

The Docker Compose configuration includes a health check that:
- Runs every 30 seconds
- Ensures the server is responding
- Automatically restarts if unhealthy

### Image Details

- **Base Image**: `python:3.11-slim`
- **Working Directory**: `/app`
- **Exposed Port**: `8080`
- **Restart Policy**: `unless-stopped`

## 🚢 CI/CD Pipeline

This project includes automated Docker image builds and publishing to Docker Hub via GitHub Actions.

### Workflow Details

The **Generate Docker Image** workflow (`.github/workflows/main.yml`) automatically:

- **Triggers on**:
  - Push to `main` branch
  - Manual workflow dispatch

- **Multi-platform builds**:
  - `linux/amd64` (x86-64)
  - `linux/arm64` (ARM 64-bit)

- **Automatic tagging strategy**:
  - `latest` - Always points to the most recent build from main
  - `sha-<commit>` - Tagged with the first 8 characters of the git commit SHA
  - `<branch>` - Tagged with the sanitized branch name (e.g., `main`)
  - `<version>` - If pushing a git tag, uses that version (e.g., `v1.0.0`)

### Example Tags

For a commit `abc12345` on the `main` branch:
- `username/winamp:latest`
- `username/winamp:sha-abc12345`
- `username/winamp:main`

For a tagged release `v1.2.3`:
- `username/winamp:latest`
- `username/winamp:sha-abc12345`
- `username/winamp:v1.2.3`

### Required Secrets

To use the automated workflow, configure these repository secrets:

- `DOCKER_USERNAME` - Your Docker Hub username
- `DOCKER_PASSWORD` - Your Docker Hub password or access token

### Running a Specific Version

Pull and run a specific version:
```bash
# Run latest version
docker run -p 8080:8080 <username>/winamp:latest

# Run specific commit
docker run -p 8080:8080 <username>/winamp:sha-abc12345

# Run specific release
docker run -p 8080:8080 <username>/winamp:v1.0.0
```

## 🛠️ Development

### Adding Custom Tracks

The player comes pre-configured with streaming radio and sample tracks. To add your own tracks, modify the `defaultTracks` array in `index.html`:

```javascript
const defaultTracks = [
  {
    metaData: {
      artist: "Artist Name",
      title: "Track Title"
    },
    url: "https://example.com/audio.mp3",
    duration: 180 // Duration in seconds, or 0 for streaming
  },
  // Add more tracks here...
];
```

**For streaming sources**, set `duration: 0`:
```javascript
{
  metaData: {
    artist: "Radio Station",
    title: "Station Name"
  },
  url: "https://example.com/stream.mp3",
  duration: 0
}
```

### Customizing the UI

The background and container styling can be modified in the `<style>` section of `index.html`.
